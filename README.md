Another C Header Repository

During my mathematical studies in the past four years I wrote a lot of code, to address the most disparate problems. Doing so, I wrote also a lot of different headers spread all over my filesystem in subfolders of folders I didn't knew I had.

This repository is a definitive attempt to organize this material in a somehow coherent and useful way.

The project is about to write codes to cover the fundamentals of algorithms and data structure, like vectors and matrices or stacks and graphs. I acknowledge that nobody needs this, nonetheless I'm putting this here on GitHub, just in case someone may find this useful (or funny) in some way.

For whar it is worth, these headers are released under the GNU GPL LICENSE, that is, you can download this and do whatever you want with it, BUT you have to keep this and derived files under the same license. Obviously given credits are appreciated, though not needed.

That being said, if you find some bug or strange behaviour or want to say something to me, please write to dan(dot)salierno(at)stud(dot)uniroma3(dot)it.

Welcome in Urdharbrunn's ACHR!
